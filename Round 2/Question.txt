Question
Champ got his salary today, so he decided to have dinner outside. He went to a restaurant having N items on the menu. The ith item on the menu belongs to the category Ai​ and requires Bi time to be cooked.
Champ wants to have a complete meal. Thus, his meal should have at least K distinct categories of food. The total time required to get all the food Champ orders is the sum of the cooking time of all the items in the order.
Help Champ find the minimum time required to have a complete meal or tell him if it is not possible to do so.
Input Format
The first line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains three lines:
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K, denoting the number of dishes on the menu and the number of distinct categories in a complete meal.
The second line contains N space-separated integers where the ith integer is Ai​, denoting the category of the ith dish in the menu.
The third line contains N space-separated integers where the ith integer is Bi, denoting the time required to cook the ith dish in the menu.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the minimum time required to have a complete meal.
If it is impossible to have a complete meal, print -1 instead.


Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N,K ≤ 105
1 ≤ Ai   ≤ 105
0 ≤ Bi ≤ 105
The sum of N over all test cases won't exceed 105

Test case 1:
Champ can choose a dish with index 2 having category 2. The total time required to get the complete meal is 1.
Test case 2:
Champ can choose dishes with index 3, 5, and 7 from the menu.
Dish 3: The dish has category 2 and requires time 0.
Dish 5: The dish has category 4 and requires time 2.
Dish 7: The dish has category 3 and requires time 1. Thus, there are 3 distinct categories and the total time to get the meal is 0 + 2 + 1 = 3. It can be shown that this is the minimum time to get the complete meal.
Test case 3:
Champ can choose the only available dish having category 5. The total time required to get the complete meal is 1.
Test case 4:
The total number of distinct categories available is 2, which is less than K. Thus, it is impossible to have a complete meal.
